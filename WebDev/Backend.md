### Backend=Server+Application+Database
---
```c
1. Server-A computer,For any live website a server should be on 24/7 .
2. For us the server is the local host coz we are making the website on our computer.
3. Application-The logic behind how i want to respond to the request from the browser.It could send back data or status code or a new HTML page.
4. If status code is 404 then it means the application does not know how to respond to the request that the browser made.
5. Database-As websites get big ,we need to store data.Database stores persistent data and it doesnt get lost.It is like a permanent storage.
6. For example:
In a restaurant there are three parts......user sees the menu(which acts as the interface)and sends a request to the kitchen(server).The chef(application) starts preparing food and brings the requuired ingredients from the pantry(database).After cooking the food the kitchen sends the ordered food as response.
7. Framewords in frontend like react.js and vue.js etc act as waiters.
8. It doesnt really matter what language you use in backend cause as long as it is sending the correct response in a correct format,it doesnt really matter.
9. Front end-HTML,CSS,JS,(Frameworks:React.js,Vue.js,Angular.js)
10. Back end-Python,Ruby ,PHP ,C#,JS,Java(Frameworks:Ruby->Rails,Java->Spring,C#->ASP.net,php->larvel/cake,Python->flask/django,Javascript->Node.js)
11. We are using because we know javascript and it can be used with react too.Most professionals use Node.js.Hence the most documentation is available for Node.js .And most of the jobs require Node.js.
