### Node.js
```c
1.What is node.js?
  1.Node.js is an open-source runtime environment that allows developers to execute JavaScript code on the server-side. It's built on the V8 JavaScript engine, which is developed by Google for its Chrome browser. Node.js enables developers to build scalable, high-performance applications by leveraging JavaScript for both client-side and server-side development.
2. Why Node.js?
  1. Javascript Everywhere-Front End and Back End makes it easier to switch.
  2. Asynchronous Non-blocking I/O-This means that the server can handle multiple connections and requests simultaneously without waiting for each one to complete before moving on to the next. This makes Node.js well-suited for building applications that require high levels of concurrency and real-time interactions, such as chat applications, online gaming, and streaming services.
  3. Performance-Built on V8 engine,hence very fast.
  4. Rich Package ecosystem-Extensive and wide range of functionalities as it is most popular.
  5. Scalable-More servers can be easily added to handle more traffic.
  6.Big community uses it,cross platform compatibility
```



```c
1. Node.js is a framework.It is an asynchronous event driven JS runtime,it is designed to build scalable network applications.
2.Why do we need a framework?You could make your own mayonnaise or use a store bought mayonnaise.So the store bought mayonnaise saves you some work and it is like a framework.
3. Framework:Reduce components and overhead.
4. Node uses V8 engine .It is fast and empowers the browser.
5. It allows us to build an application using javascript.front end is written in html,css,js and backend also uses js.Node allows to build js fullstack.It makes it possible for front end users to easily shift to backend.
6. Js Fullstack,Scalable,Non-blocking,Huge ecosystem.
 
```

### Node REPL
```c
  1. R-Read
  2. E-Evaluate
  3. P-Print
  4. L-Loop
```
```c

1. Type node in the terminal(View->Terminal) of vs code and it activates REPL.

2. Type .exit to get out of REPL.(CTRL+C multiple times (here 2 times) take you out of the command line window).

3. You can do operations in repl.

4. To run js files in node write =>node index.js.Make sure before that that you are in the correct folder.
```
### How to use Native Node modules
```c
Theyre like your starting toolset.It makes easy for making applications on server side.
