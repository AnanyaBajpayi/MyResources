- A class is the blueprint of an object.
- In IntelliJ IDEA, create a Maven project. Inside it, to add a class, go to `src/main/java`, and create a Java class using `currentpackagename.Main1` (e.g., `org.studyeasy.Main1`).
- If the variable is public, you can access it in other classes. If the variable is private, you cannot access it in any other class.
- To create getter and setter methods, go to the Code section at the top, click on generate, and select the option for getter and setter.
- If you create an instance variable and a parameter variable with the same name and don't use the `this` keyword, even after initializing your instance variable via a setter method, if you print its value using a getter method, you'll get its default value only.
- Instance variables have a default value, but a variable created inside a method block doesn't. So, if you create an instance variable `public int a;`, it is fine, but if you create a normal variable inside any method like `int a;` and do not initialize it, and try to print it, it will give an error. This is because a default constructor initializes the instance variables.
- `this.doors = doors;` // `this` keyword symbolizes the instance variable.
- It is preferred to initialize the instance variable using a constructor.
- A default constructor is created if we do not specifically create a constructor. There are three types of constructors: default, parameterized, and non-parameterized. If we don't have a constructor, Java will insert one. If we have any type of constructor, Java won't insert one.
- Inheritance: Child classes inherit data members and member objects from the parent class. For example, we have a parent class called `Vehicles`, and it has three child classes: `Bike`, `Car`, and `Truck`. To use it, we use `extends` (e.g., `Bike extends Vehicles`). The `super` method passes the value assigned in some child class constructor to the parent class.
- `toString()` helps in directly printing the information. If you also want parent class info, then use `toString() + super.toString()` from the dropdown of `toString`.
- In case of method conflict, i.e., same name classes in child and parent class, the child class wins.
- Types of inheritance: Single inheritance (A -> B), Multiple inheritance (A -> C & B -> C) (Not allowed in Java), Multilevel inheritance (A -> B -> C), Hierarchical inheritance (A -> B, A -> C, A -> D), Hybrid inheritance.
- Composition is a complex object of multiple components. For example, we create a class called `Car`. It has several properties like the number of seats, the number of wheels, engine info, battery info, etc. Now the number of seats and wheels is a simple property and can be denoted by a variable. But engine info and battery info are classes.
